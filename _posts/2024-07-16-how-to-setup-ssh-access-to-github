# Setting up SSH access for GitHub

When working with private repositories on GitHub, establishing a secure and efficient way to access code is crucial. SSH (Secure Shell) provides a robust method for authenticating to GitHub servers from the command line. In this guide, weâ€™ll walk you through the process of setting up SSH access for GitHub which enables you to clone, pull, and push to your repositories (both public and private) securely.

## Check for existing SSH keys
Before generating a new SSH key, it's a good idea to check if you already have any SSH keys on your machine. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
ls -la ~/.ssh
```

Look for files named either _id_rsa.pub_ or _id_dsa.pub_. If you find an existing key pair, consider using it. Otherwise, move on to creating a new one.

## Generate a new SSH key

To generate a new SSH key, enter the following command in your terminal. Be sure to replace your_email@example.com with your email:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

Accept the default file location when prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key." Optionally, you can secure your key with a passphrase.

## Add your SSH key to your GitHub account

1. Copy the SSH key to your clipboard
2. Visit your GitHub account and navigate to **Settings**.
3. Under the user settings sidebar, click **SSH and GPG keys**.
4. Click **New SSH key** or **Add SSH key**, provide a descriptive title for the key, and paste your key into the "Key" field.
5. Click **Add SSH key** and, if prompted, confirm your GitHub password.

## Test the SSH connection

Ensure your setup is correct by testing your SSH connection to GitHub:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

If successful, you'll receive a message saying, "Hi [your_username]! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access."
